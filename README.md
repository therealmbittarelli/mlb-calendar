# ⛄🎄 Advent Calendar 🎄⛄

Each year I "surprise" my husband and best friend with a custom digital "advent calendar". Every day from Dec 1 - Dec 25, I tuck something fun, insightful, or nostalgic onto the site that I know he'll appreciate.

I've overhauled the site's design every year thus far; video captures can be found below!

...And I have to mention that in my professional capacity as a software developer, I would not recommend the use of falling snow or blinking lights (or terrible fonts), but for a personal project that's crafted to delight someone I love, these gaudy things make it that much more fun and festive!

❄️ [2022](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/BduMN4mePK6mkzyA78iB6T?) - a click of the tree each day redirects the user to a youtube video, article, reddit post, game, or other web-based goodie
